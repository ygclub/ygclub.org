= MobileFrontend Extension =
The MobileFrontend extension adds a mobile view to your mediawiki instance.

== Installation ==
	See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Installation

== Configuration ==
See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Configuration_settings

== Development ==

=== CSS ===
We currently use http://lesscss.org/ to generate stylesheets.
Ensure when you contribute CSS code you update the less files in stylesheets/less and to generate run:

	make less

To install less via npm (node package manager)

	npm install less

When installed you may need to update your PATH so that you can run the lessc compiler. To do this edit your path (on OSX found in ~/.profile) like so (note your path may differ):

	export PATH=/Users/{username}/.npm/less/1.3.0/package/bin/.

Ensure all css passes the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/CSS style guidelines]
When adding a javascript module, ensure that the css module has the same name.
e.g. javascripts/modules/mf-toggle.js has the corresponding less/css stylesheets stylesheets/less/modules/mf-toggle.less and stylesheets/modules/mf-toggle.css

Introduce any browser specific patches in the relevant stylesheet. If the browser does not have its own stylesheet considering adding one in DeviceDetection.php

NEVER use [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#attribute-selectors attribute selectors] - these are known to cause issues in the [https://github.com/wikimedia/WikipediaMobile phonegap app] which shares some of this codebase.

=== Javascript ===
Javascript can be found in the javascript folder. Any javascript committed to the core must pass the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/JavaScript style guidelines]
A pre-commit hook is provided in the scripts directory to assist with adhering to javascript code standards

=== HTML ===
HTML should validate via http://validator.w3.org/ - note at the current time do not worry about markup introduced via wikitext.

== Images ==
If you are adding images to the extension please ensure they have been [http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/ optimised] beforehand.

=== Committing ===
* Commits are important as they give the reviewer more information to successfully review your code and find errors or potential problems you might not have thought of
* Commits are also useful when troubleshooting issues and refactoring. If it's not clear why a line of code is in the repository important bug fixes could be lost.
* Commits should be as minor as possible. Please avoid removing unrelated console.log statements, fixing unrelated whitespace etc.. do that in a separate commit which mentions the word cleanup.
* First line commit should summarise the commit with bug it fixes if applicable. e.g. Fix problem with toggling see bug x
* Second line should be blank
* Third line should go into detail where necessary providing links to blog posts/other bugs to provide more background. Mention the platforms/browsers the change is for where necessary
** e.g. 'this is a problem on Android but not OSX see http://<url> which explains problem in detail'
** e.g. 'this is a workaround for a known bug in opera mobile see http://<url>'

=== Testing ===

=== Run Test Suite ===
To run the full test suite run

	make tests

Note currently unit tests are run in the browser. It would be great to have these run using phantomjs - if anyone wants to take that challenge that would be awesome.

==== Unit tests ====
Javascript: Before commiting anything please ensure that you run [[Special:JavaScriptTest/qunit]] - ensure you do this on the desktop site!
PHP: PHP tests can be run the normal way. See [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:PHP_unit_testing/Writing_unit_tests_for_extensions]] for explanations on how to exclusively run php unit tests for the MobileFrontend extension.

==== Selenium tests ====
There are currently no selenium tests. If you want to contribute these they would be greatly received!
