These images are all at 2x resolution (48x48) for Retina and xhdpi devices.
Currently, they are scaled down in the browser for hdpi and mdpi/non-Retina devices.

We may wish to make 24x24 and 36x36 assets as well if they don't scale cleanly.


Extracted from the (vector?) icon sets in Heather & Lindsey's designer domain,
converted to grayscale+alpha and pngcrush -brute'd.
